**About Me**

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from PoliMi with a passion for both technology and creativity. My journey into the world of coding began early, tinkering with HTML on videogame forums, and has since evolved into a deep interest in software engineering and problem-solving.

Beyond the world of code, I'm also a musician. In my free time, I dive into music production using Ableton, where I get to experiment with sound and create tracks that blend my technical and artistic sides.

ðŸŽ§ **Creative Exploration**: Music is my outlet for creativity. Producing tracks on Ableton allows me to experiment with sound in ways that complement my analytical mindset.

ðŸŽ® **Tech Meets Play**: My love for videogames isn't just about playing; it's about understanding the tech behind them. This fascination with gaming continues to influence my approach to development.
