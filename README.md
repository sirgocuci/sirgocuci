**About Me**

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from PoliMi with a passion for both technology and creativity. My journey into the world of coding began early, tinkering with HTML on videogame forums, and has since evolved into a deep interest in software engineering, data science, and problem-solving.

Beyond the world of code, I'm also a musician. In my free time, I dive into music production using Ableton, where I get to experiment with sound and create tracks that blend my technical and artistic sides.
